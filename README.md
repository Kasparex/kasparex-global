## 📄 File Overview

### `dapp-template.html`
A clean starter template for new Kaspa-based dApps.  
Includes:
- Pre-wired imports for global CSS & JS
- Universal layout structure
- Placeholder panels for easy customization  
Use this as a base when building new tools/widgets.

---

### `index.html`
A minimal landing page or test entry point.  
Used mostly for quick local dev tests or to preview small features.

---

### `kasparex-init.js`
Initial setup script for global dApps.  
Handles:
- Environment setup
- Wallet detection and connection
- Base UI triggers (modals, loaders, etc.)
Should be loaded before the modules file.

---

### `kasparex-modules.js`
Bundled utility functions and modules used across Kasparex dApps.  
Includes:
- Wallet dashboard
- Token selectors
- Theme switcher
- Guide popups
- Fee handler logic
This is the core logic that powers the modular features in widgets.

### `kasparex-style.css`
Global stylesheet for all Kasparex widgets and dApps.  
Defines:
- Theme variables (light/dark)
- Unified panel layout
- Buttons, tags, loaders, modals
- Tables, alerts, nav pills, progress bars, and more  
All new dApps should rely on this file to ensure visual consistency.

---

### `kasparex-ui-showcase.html`
A live UI component demo page.  
Shows all global UI elements like:
- Panels, buttons, pills, alerts
- Stats cards, tooltips, loaders  
Useful for developers designing new widgets and dApps using the global UI system.

---

### `package.json`
Node.js config file.  
Lists dependencies (like `express`), project metadata, and start scripts.

A basic Express.js server to serve local files.  
Useful for:

## ✅ Usage Tips

- Always include `kasparex-style.css`, `kasparex-init.js`, and `kasparex-modules.js` in that order.
- Preview UI elements in `kasparex-ui-showcase.html` to stay consistent with Kasparex branding.
